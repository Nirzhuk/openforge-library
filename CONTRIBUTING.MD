# Contributing to `Openforge Library`

As the creatores and maintainers of this project, we want to ensure that `Openforge Library` will be updated and be a perfect tool for everyone.



## Code contributions - New Realease (No code!)

Here is a quick guide to doing code contributions to the library.

1. Fork and clone the repo to your local machine `git clone https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/openforge-library.git`

2. Create a new branch from `main` with a meaningful name for a new feature or an issue you want to work on: `git checkout -b your-meaningful-branch-name`

3. Install packages by running:

	> yarn

4. Start the application by running:

	> yarn dev


3. Make changes inside `src/data` and `src/pages` if needs to.

5. Ensure build passes.

	> yarn build
	
6. Push your branch: `git push -u origin your-meaningful-branch-name`

7. Submit a pull request to the upstream react-hook-form repository.

8. Choose a descriptive title and describe your changes briefly.
